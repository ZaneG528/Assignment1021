# Assignment1021
This is a practice repository for Assignment1021, which deals with cloning and changing the origin.

Tasks:
1. Find the repository https://github.com/ballard-high-ap-cs/Assignment1021 on GitHub, read the README.md file and browse its contents. See if you can deduce exactly what the program will do.
2. Clone the repository to a local folder on your workstation using GitHub Desktop
3. Change the origin of the repository so that it points to a new personal repository under your own GitHub account (not to the original ballard-high-ap-cs repository).
4. Change the code in your cloned repository so that it modifies the output in some way (for example, change a message or spelling).
5. Save and commit your changes to your local Git repository.
6. Push your changes to GitHub, then verify that your changes appear in your own repository, not in the ballard-high-ap-cs organization.
  *In your README, explain how you verified this*
7. Pair up with a classmate. Exchange your repository URLs with each other.
8. Change your repository’s origin to point to your classmate’s repository. Make a small change and attempt to push your changes to their repository.
9. In your repository’s README file, describe what happened when you tried to push your changes to their repository.  
   * What message did GitHub Desktop give you?
   * Why do you think this happened?
   * What does this reveal about how Git handles remote permissions?
The message was :
Authentication failed. Some common reasons include: - You are not logged in to your account: see File > Options.
 - You may need to log out and log back in to refresh your token.
  - You do not have permission to access this repository.
   - The repository is archived on GitHub. Check the repository settings to confirm you are still permitted to push commits.
    - If you use SSH authentication, check that your key is added to the ssh-agent and associated with your account.
     - If you use SSH authentication, ensure the host key verification passes for your repository hosting service. 
     - If you used username / password authentication, you might need to use a Personal Access Token instead of your account password. Check the documentation of your repository hosting service.
     This means that I didnt have permission to change the code as he didnt give me acsess.
     You need to be assigned permissions to change anything in a repository remotly.
